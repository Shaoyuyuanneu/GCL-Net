# Important updata in the manuscript: After we submitted this manuscript, we found that an important assumption was not clear. In this manuscript, we assume the ground truth of boundary 
points is known in the training, validation and testing sets. As long as accurate boundary information can be obtained, the results of semantic segmentation 
can be greatly improved.
